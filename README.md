# Vault

Vault is a 2D Hack and Slash Side-Scroller in which you control a warrior named Jeb seeking his estranged sister in the Land of Ogden. You must ravage through hoards of monsters lurking the Woods of Old, Terror Caverns, and the Bastardly Bulkheads. You only have your trusty Blade of Honor and wits to survive.

Jebâ€™s movement is controlled by WASD and his attacks are triggered by the Spacebar. There are 3 enemy types(in ascending order of lethality): Slimes, Skeletons, and Minotaurs. Each enemy takes a certain amount of hits to destroy and each has their own weapon and speed. The slime is brisk and attacks by headbutting anything close enough to its eyeline. The skeleton slowly limps toward the player and utilizes a makeshift sword to slash the living. The minotaur is stationary and will swing at anything that dares approach its area of effect.  In addition to enemy attack damage, the player takes 1 damage if an enemy comes into contact with the player.

The game takes place in 3 different sections: a forest, a cave, and bulkhead. Each has its own enemies and challenges for the player to face. In addition, the contrasting color pallets show a sense of real progression through the game and story. The player, enemy, and heart sprites are 8-bit models that harken back to indie games of the early 2010s.
